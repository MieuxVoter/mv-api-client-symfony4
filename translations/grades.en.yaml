# We have to rewrite the grades in the name.  Sorry.
# We could generate the name suffix, but it adds annoying "missing translations" notices,
# and we could not find how to tell the FormType to skip the translation step altogether.
#
# The order of the gradings in this file do not matter.
#
# See App\Entity\Poll::GRADING_PRESETS  to register a new grading.
